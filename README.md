# campalto
A simple example wayland compositor used to explore wlroots and rendering with the drm.
The code is based on the tinywl project in wlroots and Drew DeVault's blog on writing wayland compositors.
It's planned to eventually develop this project into a fully featured wayland compositor.

Btw.: Campalto is an island at Venice with a nice sounding name.
